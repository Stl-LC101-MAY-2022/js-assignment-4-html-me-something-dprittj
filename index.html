               <h2>What is a gallery wall?</h2><!---first headline, but less important than next-->
                  <p>
                     A gallery wall is almost self-explanatory, but I'll admit I wasn't clear on what it was at first when my then-longtime girlfriend/now-Fiancee (with the capital F, as she will be referred to henceforth) first proposed it. Asking the internet what a gallery wall is and here we come to the simplest, shortest explanation: "A gallery wall (or salon wall) is loosely defined as a collection of items: framed artwork, photographs and personal treasures hung in a grouping."<sup>1</sup>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     So there we go. The cited article below explains further about gallery walls'  history and current place in the design-sphere, and the internet has no shortage of example photos, rules to follow, ideas, etc. But right here, right now, we're not worried about All Gallery Walls. I'm here to show you around the vertical plane of just one.

                     This is the current state of our gallery wall. We hope you like it! Keep reading to learn more about how we put it together and chose the pieces that we did!

                  <p>
                     Making our gallery wall was an organic process: we had just about every piece of wall art we'd collected up to that point there with us in the room and light fare on the television in the background. The first piece was pretty easily chosen and placed just about dead-center. After that, the rest of the wall came together slowly, each of us holding up candidate pieces in various places around our central lodestone, making a case for why it should or shouldn't go on the wall, leaving space for both of us to be represented (as we both can tend to have strong design choices from time to time), discussing how to keep the whole wall balanced while letting it reveal itself to us. I'm pretty sure there were a few rounds of drinks, as well. 
                     <br><br>
                     In the end, I know we are both in love with what the wall has become. It is the central feature one sees upon entering our apartment and so couldn't make our home feel more like our home. Friends, family, and delivery persons comment on it when they see it, and honestly, too often I can't stop looking at it—and now I never have to. So let's take a tour across the Wall and find out how it came to be, piece by piece, and why these pieces became the chosen ones.

            <h3>Missouri HeartStrings</h3>
            <p>
               (String, nails, wood, paint, by Fiancee)
               
               Missouri is, and has been for some time, home for me. I am not a Missouri native and yet it is where I tell people I'm “from”; it is my home<sup>*</sup>. My fiancee has only ever briefly lived out of the state and is the artist who created the center piece of our current apartment's gallery wall. Inspired by similar pieces of art she saw online some years ago, before it became the mainstay here it still held a central role in our previous apartment, the place of its creation. There, it hung on a small wall above our microwave, which sat upon a cabinet jutting out from the wall just separating the alcove kitchen and bathroom. That was a tiny (by Midwest standards) “shotgun-style” apartment in a four-family flat, and that tiny wall space, facing the breakfast nook that constituted our dining space, was the central location of that apartment; the fulcrum on which the balance of our new life together rested; the perfect place to hang our heart. So when we eventually moved from that small apartment into something a little bigger and we had collected around us all of our various pieces of wall art to begin piecing together this new gallery wall, there was no question in my mind where to start: start with the heart, first.

            <h3>The "Enchantment Under the Sea Dance" Poster</h3>
            <p>
               If the information listed on this poster looks familiar to the viewer, then I'd like to remind you of the the immortal words of Emmett “Doc” Brown: “Your future hasn't been written yet! No one's has! Your future is whatever you make it—so make it a good one.” For the uninitiated, or those with only a passing familiarity, Doc Brown is one of the main characters of the Back to the Future film trilogy and the “Enchantment Under the Sea” dance is pivotal to the first film's conflict! 
               
               This poster was a gift to Fiancee and I from a friend who happened to be with us when we first saw it, and, I believe, the second piece we actually hung after the Missouri Heartstrings. Fiancee, friend, and I were all at the 2016 Loufest together, a now-defunct Saint Louis music festival (and topic to which we shall return later!), browsing merchant booths, and Fiancee and I basically gushed over the poster as soon as we saw it. Now, we didn't buy it at the time, probably because it was earlier in the day and we didn't want to have to keep track of a poster all day. Then, a few weeks later, we received a corrugated tube in the mail. Well, what could it be?! Our friend, who came into town rather suddenly to join us for the festival, had found the seller's online store and had a print of the poster sent to us as a thank you for letting him stay at our place and join us for the weekend! 
               
               And Fiancee and I have long been a fan of the Back to the Future films! The jokes, the performances, the set designs, costumes, music, and cinematography; their 1980s main setting, their golden era science fiction plots, their embrace of Americana of many different eras, and in the end, their message: your future is whatever you make of it! So make it a good one.

            <h3>Threaded Rainbow Hanger</h3>
            <p>
               This piece was purchased by Fiancee at a local craft fair. Originally meant as a rear-view mirror hanger for your car, Fiancee thought it fit nicely and aesthetically in this little space off to the right, a space that sat empty for a couple years after the initial development. I couldn't agree more with her decision: it fits aesthetically with the general mood of the wall while adding a new value all its own, and complements the other small piece off to the side there that, for too long, was a lone outlier, giving our wall a more natural, soft boundary where before it had a sudden (though not offensive) curved edge. It is also one of only three pieces that were added to the gallery wall after its initial piecing together.

            <p>
               This mini-crochet circle was a gift to Fiancee from a friend and gifted-craftswoman of hers (who, naturally, is also an art teacher). Represented on it are all things “My Favorite Murder”, a popular true crime podcast the two are both big fans of. This was the first item added to the gallery wall after its initial piecing together.

            <p>
               These are two prints Fiancee found at another local artist's fair. The gold heart reflects the central Missouri Heart (and both are echoed further on the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance Poster and Shake It Off). These are things that we've loved, because they're beautiful or in them we see meaning. (Flip previous lines clauses). I particularly like seeing the same golden triangles configured to both resemble a symbolic structure—the Heart—and a random pattern, and both with a golden hued geometric shape. Its not just pretty, its interesting. And as what they do to help constitute the whole wall, I think their negative space helps keep the rest of the wall aloft—it seems almost weightless against the ground.
