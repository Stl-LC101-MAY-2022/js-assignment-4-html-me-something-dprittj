               <h2>What is a gallery wall?</h2>
                  <p>
                  A gallery wall is basically self-explanatory, but I'll admit I wasn't clear on what it was at first when my now-Fiancee first proposed it. So, asking the internet what a gallery wall is and here we come to the simplest, shortest explanation: "A gallery wall (or salon wall) is loosely defined as a collection of items: framed artwork, photographs and personal treasures hung in a grouping."<sup>1</sup>
                     <br><br>
                  And there we go. The writer explains further about gallery walls'  history and current place in the design-sphere, and the internet has no shortage of example photos, rules to follow, ideas, etc, and is interesting read (see link at bottom). But right here, right now, we're not worried about All Gallery Walls. I'm here to show you around the vertical plane of just one.

                        <p>
                        This is the current state of our gallery wall. We hope you like it! Keep reading to learn more about how we put it together and chose the pieces that we did!

                                 Our wall was not to show off any particular piece(s) of art but to be a display of things we love.

                                 <p>
                                 Making our gallery wall was an organic process: we had just about every piece of wall art we'd collected up to that point there with us in the room and light fare on the television in the background. The first piece was pretty easily chosen and placed just about dead-center. After that, the rest of the wall came together slowly, each of us holding up candidate pieces in various places around our central lodestone, making a case for why it should or shouldn't go on the wall, leaving space for both of us to be represented (as we both can tend to have strong design choices from time to time), discussing how to keep the whole wall balanced while letting it reveal itself to us. I'm pretty sure there were a few rounds of drinks, as well. 
                                    <br><br>
                                 In the end, I know we are both in love with what the wall has become. It is the central feature one sees upon entering our apartment and so couldn't make our home feel more like our home. Friends, family, and delivery persons comment on it when they see it, and honestly, too often I can't stop looking at it—and now I never have to. So let's take a tour across the Wall and find out how it came to be, piece by piece, and why these pieces became the chosen ones.

                                    Missouri is, and has been for some time, home for me. I am not a Missouri native and yet it is where I tell people I'm “from”; it is my home<sup>*</sup>. My fiancee has only ever briefly lived out of the state and is the artist who created the center piece of our current apartment's gallery wall. Inspired by similar pieces of art she saw online some years ago, before it became the mainstay here it still held a central role in our previous apartment, the place of its creation. There, it hung on a small wall above our microwave, which sat upon a cabinet jutting out from the wall just separating the alcove kitchen and bathroom. That was a tiny (by Midwest standards) “shotgun-style” apartment in a four-family flat, and that tiny wall space, facing the breakfast nook that constituted our dining space, was the central location of that apartment; the fulcrum on which the balance of our new life together rested; the perfect place to hang our heart. So when we eventually moved from that small apartment into something a little bigger and we had collected around us all of our various pieces of wall art to begin piecing together this new gallery wall, there was no question in my mind where to start: start with the heart, first.

                                    If the information listed on this poster looks familiar to the viewer, then I'd like to remind you of the the immortal words of Emmett “Doc” Brown: “Your future hasn't been written yet! No one's has! Your future is whatever you make it—so make it a good one.” For the uninitiated, or those with only a passing familiarity, Doc Brown is one of the main characters of the Back to the Future film trilogy and the “Enchantment Under the Sea” dance is pivotal to the first film's conflict!

                                    This poster was a gift to Fiancee and I from a friend who happened to be with us when we first saw it, and, I believe, the second piece we actually hung after the Missouri Heartstrings. Fiancee, friend, and I were all at the 2016 Loufest together, a now-defunct Saint Louis music festival (and topic to which we shall return later!), browsing merchant booths, and Fiancee and I basically gushed over the poster as soon as we saw it. Now, we didn't buy it at the time, probably because it was earlier in the day and we didn't want to have to keep track of a poster all day. Then, a few weeks later, we received a corrugated tube in the mail. Well, what could it be?! Our friend, who came into town rather suddenly to join us for the festival, had found the seller's online store and had a print of the poster sent to us as a thank you for letting him stay at our place and join us for the weekend! 
                                    <br><br>
                                    And Fiancee and I have long been a fan of the Back to the Future films! The jokes, the performances, the set designs, costumes, music, and cinematography; their 1980s main setting, their golden era science fiction plots, their embrace of Americana of many different eras, and in the end, their message: your future is whatever you make of it! So make it a good one.

                                    <p>
                                       This piece was purchased by Fiancee at a local craft fair. Originally meant as a rear-view mirror hanger for your car, Fiancee thought it fit nicely and aesthetically in this little space off to the right, a space that sat empty for a couple years after the initial development. I couldn't agree more with her decision: it fits aesthetically with the general mood of the wall while adding a new value all its own, and complements the other small piece off to the side there that, for too long, was a lone outlier, giving our wall a more natural, soft boundary where before it had a sudden (though not offensive) curved edge. It is also one of only three pieces that were added to the gallery wall after its initial piecing together.

                                    This mini-crochet circle was a gift to Fiancee from a friend and gifted-craftswoman of hers (who, naturally, is also an art teacher). Represented on it are all things “My Favorite Murder”, a popular true crime podcast the two are both big fans of. This was the first item added to the gallery wall after its initial piecing together.

                                    This poster is part of a duo Fiancee found online from an artist who specializes in travel posters for pop culture locations. This poster advertises the Forbideen Forest, a forest just off the grounds of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the Harry Potter book series magic-verse. While we are both fans of the main Harry Potter books and movies series, Fiancee is definitely a more knowledgeable fan and, beyond that, fond of unicorns as well. (The other travel poster we acquired along with this one features Hill Valley, by the way, for those fans of the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance Poster!)

                                    <p>
                                    This mini marquee was purchased from a national big box store for no particular reason, possibly decor, possibly other. We had it with us when putting together the gallery wall, which turned out to be quite fortuitous! When mock-placing various pieces (holding them against the wall to view their potential impact on the overall wall), we were wanting to place the photo of us but realized we were working with an awkwardly sized space. Trying to center the photo in that space beside the wall's edge and the Forbidden Forest poster left an aesthetically displeasing amount of negative space around the photo. However, we didn't have many smaller pieces at the time to help fill the remaining space created by adjusting the photo closer towards one of the other objects. Luckily, this mini marquee came to mind! Not only did it nicely fit in the space but it added a new medium to the wall. Once that was decided, the message displayed was a relatively short one, though I don't recall the specifics. The unofficial name of our neighborhood--the area we first moved in toggether and still live--is Dogtown, and promoting our love for the neighborhood seemed like the most natural message to display.

                              <h3>Skyrim Map Art</h3>
                                 <p>
                                 This is map art of the acclaimed video game "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim". A favorite game of mine, this piece was given to me by Fiancee as a gift. It's leans into minimalism with calming and cool-colored hues providing for a broad but unbusy piece. It's colorful palette, while light, provides some much needed contrast to this lower area of the wall as many darker or heavier hues dominate this side of the wall.

                        This photo, of Fiancee and I attending our first St. Louis Cardinals game as a dating couple, was taken by one of the team's roving photographers and given to her by me as a holiday gift many years ago. Naturally, it has particular sentimental value to us both and so was an easy pick for the gallery wall. We didn't want the wall to be too centered around us <em>per se</em> but more our interests. However, this particular photo we felt deserved a place on the wall! We are fans of the local team, too, of course, and have attended numerous games together!

                        These are two prints Fiancee found at another local artist's fair. The gold heart reflects the central Missouri Heart (and both are echoed further on the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance Poster and Shake It Off). These are things that we've loved, because they're beautiful or in them we see meaning. (Flip previous lines clauses). I particularly like seeing the same golden triangles configured to both resemble a symbolic structure—the Heart—and a random pattern, and both with a golden hued geometric shape. Its not just pretty, its interesting. And as what they do to help constitute the whole wall, I think their negative space helps keep the rest of the wall aloft—it seems almost weightless against the ground.

                     This is the official poster for the 2016 Loufest music festival in St. Louis. Now defunct, Fiancee and I attended this even several years in a row and every year Loufest went with a different art style/theme to highlight in all of their official merchandise. So we didn't buy a poster for every year of the festival, but this one particularly caught Fiancee's eye. It's not hard to see why: there's a lot going on in a managed way. The imagery is striking and familiar, evoking a range of aesthetic themes: from the arcane to the divine, the cycle of life to the end of days, the history of St. Louis and perhaps its future. On the wall, aside from revealing our shared interest in music and live performances, the color scheme helps balance and give weight to this side of the wall while further renegotiating the strength of the two larger pieces (the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance and the Skyrim Map Art). As I recall, it was chosen and hung in partnership with another of the large pieces for the express purpose of creating both scale balance and color contrast--a double win (like most of the choices)!

                  These two pieces reflect Fiancee, first with a Taylor Swift-inspired art piece from a local artist, and secondly with a beautiful flower print gifted to her by her crafty friend mentioned above, from a popular online stationary, design, and print retailer.
                  <br><br>
                  Taylor Swift is arguably one of the greatest single music artists of today, inspiring millions of people to pursue their dreams and silence their haters, especially in an often hostile industry. Her success is itself readily apparent. And in her song "Shake It Off" maybe we can all find some advice on how to succeed and find happiness in our lives:
                     "But I keep cruisin'
                     Can't stop, won't stop groovin'
                     It's like I got this music in my mind
                     Sayin', 'It's gonna be alright'"
                     <br><br>
                  Not only is this piece of art lovely in its rendition of this keep-moving attitude, serving as a reminder to take what comes our way and, if we can, shake it off to keep going towards our goals, but it is the beauty of it is then advanced to yet a slightly further degree by its frame, made by a friend of ours. In this way, this piece represents not just Fiancee's admiration for Taylor Swift, but imparts some important words to remember and, along with the inclusion of several other gifted items on the wall, further displays the importance of those around us in both our lives.
                  <br><br>
                  And the same can be said of the second piece displayed: a beautiful flower print gifted to Fiancee. While formerly it was displayed unframed on a stand on our bookshelves, the addition of it on the wall, in the appropriately designated frame that it is (another of Fiancee's talents), adds a dose of both levity--via its surface reading as just a flower print--and anchorage--by its contrasting nature of being a light colored print against a dark background--to what was formerly a bit of a drifting edge to original gallery display.

                     <p>
                     Once again, as is the case for so many of the pieces, both of these Superman-oriented pieces were gifts to me by Fiancee, though at different times. The double-inclusion of my favorite superhero, however, is due to the fact that they are such different pieces, with different properties and origins. The first piece described comes from an artist whose work Fiancee found online, while the second piece is an original work of Fiancee's!
                     <br><br>
                     The vertical piece with Superman silhouetted in a commanding pose with sun-rising hues is more mural-like, utilizing a lot of traditional Superman-oriented imagery: the commanding pose, the family crest/'S'-chest shield, the sun as the source of his power, Superman in flight, and finally the Fortress of Solitude. It contains so many super-elements in a well composed and colored way that deviates from the typical bold primary colors of red, yellow, and blue that, to me, both celebrates the source material and provides a unique artistic vision.
                     <br><br>
                     The blue and white Fortress of Solitude is an original painting by Fiancee! In short, I love it! It's a show of both her wonderful talents and my interests. It's palette is mainly just a beautiful blue and white and at a mere glance it is immediately recognizable as the legendary Fortress of Solitude, Superman's refuge on Earth. I couldn't be prouder to have it displayed centrally at the top of our gallery wall (partially also due to it's rising, pointed shapes--where else would it go?)!

                     Calvin and Hobbes. There's a lot I could say about Bill Watterson's seminal comic strip and yet it would only amount to a fraction of the justice his work deserves. Although it ended nearly 30 years ago its influence is still evident today. Not only does Watterson's art remain uniquely stylistic for a comic medium, but the characters, themes, situations, and witty irreverence towards all things, large and small, keep the series endlessly entertaining, even nearly three decades past its run. I should know, I've loved the series since I was 8 years old and have nearly all of the collections. One day, though!
                     <br><br>
                     This particular print was purchased for me as a gift from Fiancee. And it couldn't have been more perfect! This piece not only demonstrates Watterson's precise grasp of his craft in its art--from the overlapping panel layout, to the use of negative space to draw the reader in, to the varying backgrounds and degrees of detail--but it wonderfully conveys the oft-present absurdism of his writing: here, while engaging in their favorite pasttime of taking a wagon (or in winter, a sled) down a dangerously steep hill, Calvin cannot help but ponder the point of philosophy, is asking the big questions a productive use of our time? Does anything really matter? In the second panel, we see Calvin completely turned away from their downhill dangers, looking directly at Hobbes in the back of the wagon as he asks his best buddy about these ponderances. And knowing right where to put a punchline, Watterson draws Hobbes covering his eyes in the final panel, as the two fall from some great height, while commenting that maybe sometimes a little faith isn't such a bad idea! 
                     <br><br>
                     This was an amazing gift not only because I'm a huge fan of C&H and its a great example of Watterson's brilliance, but on a more personal level, as a college graduate who majored in Philosophy, I know exactly the turmoil Calvin is going through. :D
